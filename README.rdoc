avro_client

An Avro client wrapper that encapsulates some common failover behavior. This is based on Evan Weaver's Thrift-Client [http://github.com/fauna/thrift_client].

== Features

* Transparent connection management
* Configurable failover and retry backoff

== Usage

Instantiate a client:

  options = { :protocol => MAIL_PROTOCOL }
  client = AvroClient.new(["localhost:9091", "localhost:9090", "localhost:9092"], options)

You can then make calls to the server via the <tt>client</tt> instance as if was your Avro requestor. The connection will be opened lazily and methods will be proxied through.

  avro.request("mail", params)
  or
  avro.mail(params)

  Please note that the method name (e.g. "mail") cannot be "send".

On failures, the client will try the remaining servers in the list before giving up. See AvroClient for more.

== Installation

You need Ruby 1.8 or 1.9. If you have those, just run:

  sudo gem install avro_client

== Examples

  1. First start the server:
    ruby test/sample_server.rb

  2. Run the script from another shell:
    ruby test/make_sample_script 

  3. Output from the server:
    $ ruby test/sample_server.rb
    Requests processed 1
    Requests processed 2
    Requests processed 3

  4. Output from the script:
    $ ruby test/make_sample_script

    avro.make_sample('sample_name' => Foo, 'sample_count' => 5)
    ===========================================
    [{"name"=>"Foo", "id"=>1, "maker"=>"Foobar"},
     {"name"=>"Foo", "id"=>2, "maker"=>"Foobar"},
     {"name"=>"Foo", "id"=>3, "maker"=>"Foobar"},
     {"name"=>"Foo", "id"=>4, "maker"=>"Foobar"},
     {"name"=>"Foo", "id"=>5, "maker"=>"Foobar"}]

    avro.make_sample('sample_name' => , 'sample_count' => 2)
    ===========================================
    [{"name"=>"default sample name", "id"=>1, "maker"=>"Foobar"},
     {"name"=>"default sample name", "id"=>2, "maker"=>"Foobar"}]

    avro.make_sample('sample_name' => Bar, 'sample_count' => -3)
    ===========================================
    "#<ArgumentError: Invalid sample count specified>"

== Tests

  ruby test/test_simple.rb
  -- This test forks a server process and sends avro requests to the server using avro client.

  ruby test/test_multiple_servers.rb
  -- This test forks two servers and checks if avro requests are sent to both servers.
